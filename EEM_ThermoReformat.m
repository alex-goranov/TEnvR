%% Description
% This code takes one or multiple processed EEM spectra output by a 
% Thermo Scientific Lumina spectrfluorometer and converts them into a regular csv format.
% The EEM spectrum must be located in a .xls files (Microsoft Excel 97-2003 Worsheet). 

% Example: 
% Run the code by typing EEM_ThermoReformat in the command windwow.
