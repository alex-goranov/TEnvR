%% Description

% This code takes multiple Water Raman spectra exported by an Aqualog fluorometer
% Filenames must end with " - RSUNIT (01) - Raman Area Graph.dat". 
% Data is exported as two-dimensional arrays in .csv files.

% Example: 
% Run the code by typing EEM_WaterRamanReformatAqualog in the command windwow.
