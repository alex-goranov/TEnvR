classdef FTMS_ConfigurationAssignment
%% Description 

% This is a configuration code for the codes performing FT-ICR-MS data
% processing (FTMS_RefinementPeaks, FTMS_FormulaAssignment, FTMS_RefinementFormulas).

% Please record any changes that you make in your laboratory notebook. We
% also recommend to save a separate configuration file for each different
% project. Please note that if you change the filename of the file in the
% TEnvR folder, you also must change the filename on line 1 above
% corresponding to classdef.
