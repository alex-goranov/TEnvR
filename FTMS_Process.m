function FTMS_Process(sample,blank,config)
%% Description

% This code takes an FT-ICR-MS file with calibrated data for a sample and a blank and:
    %1) Refines the peak list of the sample using FTMS_RefinementPeaks
    %2) Assigns molecular formulas to the refined peak list using FTMS_FormulaAssignment
    %3) Refined the molecular formulas using FTMS_RefinementFormulas

% Example
% FTMS_Process('Sample 2.txt','Blank PPL.txt',FTMS_ConfigurationAssignment)
