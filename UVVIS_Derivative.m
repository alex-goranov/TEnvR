function varargout = UVVIS_Derivative(filename_sample)
%% Description

% This code takes a UV-VIS spectrum (wavelength in column one, absorbance values in column two)
% and take its derivative. Higher order derivatives can be taken by applying the code multiple times. 
% The spectrum must be located in a .csv file (comma-separated values). 

% Examples:
% UVVIS_Derivative('Sample 3_Final.csv')
% UVVIS_Derivative('Sample 1_Final_deriv.csv')
% UVVIS_Derivative('Sample 1_Final_deriv_deriv.csv')
