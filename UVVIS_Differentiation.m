%% Description

% This code takes multiple UV-VIS spectra (wavelength in column one, absorbance values in column two)
% and calculates differential ("difference") spectra. The files must have
% already been processed and thus labeled as "_Final". 
% All spectra must be located in .csv files (comma-separated values). 

% Example: 
% Run the code by typing UVVIS_Differentiation in the command windwow.
