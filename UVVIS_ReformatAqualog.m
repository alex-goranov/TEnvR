%% Description

% This code takes multiple UV-VIS spectra exported by an Aqualog Fluorometer.
% Filename must end with "- Abs Spectra Graphs.dat". The code reformats files 
% into two-dimensional arrays and export them into .csv files.

% Example: 
% Run the code by typing UVVIS_ReformatAgualog in the command windwow.
